## So what is this repository for?

This repository if for giving ideas for future releases of Better Flint &amp; Steels. It is also for giving
any issues that may occur with this mod; though for the moment, I doubt there will be any issues, unless there
are any mod conflicts I am unaware of. So some general guidelines for this repository...

### If the game crashes on start up.

If your game is crashing on start up, it's most-likely to be your end and not mine. Please make sure you have
a stable release of Forge installed and not using forge before Build 1.12.2-14.23.0.2486, the most stable release
is listed for Build 1.12.2 - 14.23.4.2705 but the lastest version is fine as well. Also make sure you are using an 
up-to-date version of Java 8 - and not before, don't have Java 6 installed.

Another thing to check before making an Issue is to make sure all mods are up-to-date to prevent any conflicts or
bugs that may be present in those versions of other mods.

### Making an Issue for the mod

If the above is true and everything is fine, then there may be a bug I am unaware of. 
Please follow the next few steps:
- Please start off your issue with [Issue] so I know this is definitely an issue report.
- Specify what isn't working, limitedly, after performing the first step.
- Explain the best you can what this issue is in the description box, be precise and detailed.
- Be respectful.
- Only English; if it's not your first language, please do the best possible.
- Proper English grammar, US is acceptable but grammar will look different to UK.
#### If the above cannot be met, do not report an issue.

### Making a Recommendation for the mod

Recommendations cannot be guarantueed in future releases but there may be influence, since this mod is community-somewhat
based, your GitHub name will be included in the catalogue and a little note next to it briefly mentioning if it was
an actual recommendation or influence for the feature added. If you wish to make a recommendation, please follow the next
few steps:
