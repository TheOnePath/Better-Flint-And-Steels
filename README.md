## So what is this repository for?

This repository if for giving ideas for future releases of Better Flint &amp; Steels. It is also for giving
any issues that may occur with this mod; though for the moment, I doubt there will be any issues, unless there
are any mod conflicts I am unaware of. So some general guidelines for this repository...

### If the game crashes on start up.

If your game is crashing on start up, it's most-likely to be your end and not mine. Please make sure you have
a stable release of Forge installed and not using forge before Bluid 1.12.2-14.23.0.2486, the most stable release
is listed for Build 1.12.2 - 14.23.4.2705 but the lastest version is fine as well. Also make sure you are using an 
up-to-date version of Java 8 - and not before, don't have Java 6 installed.

Another thing to check before making an Issue is to make sure all mods are up-to-date to prevent any conflicts or
bugs that me be present in those versions of other mods.
